            <div class="subtitle">PART ONE: MONITORING DEEP STATES OF REALITY AND DISSECTING THE COMPLEX INFORMATIONAL IMPACT ON THE COLLECTIVE HUMAN UNCONSCIOUS</div>
            <div class="section">1.2. UNCOVERING THE HUMAN ILLUSION NETWORK</div>
            <br>
            <p>All human languages and dialects eventually intersect at the station or concept of language, and despite the difference and divergence of human languages and methods of writing and expressing the manifestations of external reality, all of them are in the end a certain simple way to express the manifestations, limits, coordination and reflections of the external reality and the interactions of the mind and awareness with the external world and its relative manifestations, with the aim of making the mind in the end comprehend the image of reality and the image of the facts that occur in the external reality and that express a certain deep essence that the human mind tries to reach but it is only reach or touches its surfaces and external reflections, and in many cases the mind denies that and believes that it has reached the depths of matters and this is the result of the system of its program which mentally subject to a tight complexity that made it see itself in an unreal way resulting from certain informational reflections that the mental system is pre-programmed on.</p>
            
            <p>Through the times and ages, man often writes information that passes through his mind and wanted to store it in a certain way, some of which may be so deep and strange at the same time that humans or the majority of them reject this information as a result of their relative thinking or the inability of their minds to absorb such complexity and strange depth that was brought up earlier, and some other information can be ridiculous or very ordinary, i.e. it stores certain content that the mind accepts to the point where humans accept it later and take it seriously, legally and fundamentally in the world.., what matters here is how the unconscious collective mind receives the flow of different information coming from the vast, different and complex information pool units with its comprehensive contents in the reality system on Earth.</p>
            
            <p>The unconscious collective mind receives a lot of information and takes them on logical acceptance curve in a manner commensurate with its overall mental programming, which is reduced the reality of the mind itself in a particular structure, in a clearer sense the mind accepts any information provided that their corresponds with the mind processor system levels and with thinking which is subject to a particular systemic processor, and this is something that contradicts the system of real vision of reality…, we take what our mental programming can accept and everything else we reject in various forms, whether we reject it as a result of our limited and programmed relative awareness on this conditional essence, or as a result of the illusory life system in which we are present which contains its illusory, ridiculous and oppressive elements such as the religious system, the political system, the material scientific system, the social system, and many other elements and other matters that we cannot delve into now.</p>
            
            <p>We are working by the system of our subconscious mind to strengthen and increase applying our self-possession program , self-obsession program , self-control program on our self-constrained to continue applying this shortening and reduction program against the real reality system, so we are accustomed and we become more accustomed to our forced self and our program and our forced reality program which planted in us a certain programmatic rules at the human - earthly - mundane level and on the existential - cosmic - informational level to keep us in our situation and our human condition which depicts a weak relative condition that indicates that we are part of the nature and are subject to the nature in a way that is inevitably pre-programmed.</p>
            
            <p>But if the human mind contemplates with a deep awareness this methodological image that captures and incarnate and represent the human being reality and himself and which forms his present part, he will gradually see and realize that the reality whose foundations and its movements have been studied is basically a system that contains and stores certain informational embroidery to which the human mind adheres..., the system of the subconscious mind has become directs the real powers of the human mind and it made up the restricted intellectual and deductive movement in a difference existential way...which is one of the form of the certain informational embroidery.</p>
            
            <p>The mind and human self believes in certain different things that represent a specific belief system that they adhere to on the mental, psychological and spiritual levels, but all this faith is in fact nothing but an absurd and futility or weak relative meaning that came through the reflections and interactions of the cerebral nervous system and the subconscious - spiritual - inner psychological system of the human self which controls the human being and directs his consciousness within certain dimensions and perception points in reality .., this is the faith, a product of an illusion that was generated nervously within the programmed brain level, and before that, it was certainly generated within the spiritual, emotional and psychological level of the human self , so the faith transforms in its many forms to capture the human self with its developed state of faith.</p>
            
            <p>In many cases, information that comes from the outside world is a specific pattern information fields that are accurately processed by the mind using the same artificial human model or models that represent human perception typical languages - paradigm languages of human cognition, such as mathematics as a human perception typical language that represents a particular model that is used to understand, process and perceive the movements prevailing in the external world, as well as physics as another human perception typical language that represents another model as well.., all of them constitute artificial human perception models and languages whose purpose is to analyses the movements of the external world, but all these languages and perception models at human society are work to analyses a specific part of reality based on the external phenotypic state of the world and its interactions and apparent results, but the transcendental deep and true vision of the depth of those movements and external manifestations is not based on these primarily artificial and specific models or not based on these human perception typical languages basis - paradigm languages of human cognition basis.</p>
            
            <p>The model, mathematical and relative perceptual analysis of information and movements of this external reality did not give the mind the true inner image that animates or control from behind the curtain the images of things, movements and appearances in the external world, the true inner image which is basically the deep part of that specific information system in the cosmic existential reality, and information that prevails in reality established and establishes the reality around us and in us and information which have in the background of their deep origins the roots of super mental dimensions, and even there is another beings that possess the roots of those super mental or spiritual - vital dimensions, we refer to the dimensions that contains inner meanings and inner images that did not show or appear in the vision of the current human mind, that is, the humans could not perceive their real possibility of their existence , the deep images and movements of reality were not established and did not appear in the trunk of the program of the collective mental vision of human beings, and we, on a human subconscious level, have filled in a certain way (unconsciously) the voids of the internal control program in our mind and our mind environment, every human individual is informational statement with neurological, mental, spiritual and psychological dimensions, filled with indoctrination of the external world and its illusory factors and elements.</p>
            
            <p>Thus, each particular human individual in this case is governed by the arms of the world of the illusory system and its receptors located and latent in the human brain, that is, the receptors inherent in the sensory nervous system, which is in itself a basic receiver of the elements, movements and effects of the illusory system.</p>
            
            <p>In one way or another, we conclude that each of us is stuck within his own stereotypical mental level, which is constructed and developed by the external factors (factors of illusory system) of the world around him and which affected him by many ways.</p>
