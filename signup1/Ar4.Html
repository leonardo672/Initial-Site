            <br>
            <p>
                In ancient human ages, they were converting sounds and meanings into specific symbols, and they were exploiting information and clarifying it in various forms. What they explained or referred to during those successive antiquities is often considered by many people today as ancient human delusion resulting from human backwardness that existed in ancient times. For many, ancient information is a myth, superstition, and absurd illusions, but for others, this information represents inexplicable exclamation points that may cause anxiety in the current human being. Others believe that this information is strange irony that must be rejected, and they do not pay any attention to the deep points indicated in this information. However, by looking deeply through ancient times, many images and signs that were present and embraced by humans in those times emerge, most of which contradict the logic of the current human world. These include information indicating the existence of deep and strange things such as communications between humans on Earth and other beings or energies existing on other planets or in galaxies and different external dimensions. Additionally, there are advanced and wonderful scientific ideas that suggest that humans of former times had knowledge that does not align with the perception of those times as backward. Our minds have adopted this torn, backward stereotype as a result of our mental awareness conflicting with deep reality, which is compatible with the illusion and banality of the current reality.
                </p>
                <p>
                Upon closer inspection, an image may emerge indicating the possibility of advanced civilizations that existed previously and were aware of reality in a deeper way than we are now. Looking into the possibility of great civilizations that inhabited the Earth in the past and then disappeared may provide ambiguous signs and meanings that suggest doubt and a need for reconsideration and redefinition of human reality, including ideas of human evolution or creation, the nature of the earthly world and reality, and the foundations of religions and the world that formed in our reality.
                </p>
                <p>
                We are not talking about any specific civilization that common minds have missed; rather, we are referring to previous evolutionary dimensions and advanced deep contributions from ancient times, whether by human action or non-human action, i.e., by other beings or energies whose logic we may not understand. Some of these energies became buried in the unknown reality and are immersed in deep meanings that are difficult to revive in our current reality, leaving us with only rare tracks and signs from ancient times.
                </p>
                <p>
                Far from these matters, and intersecting with the basic concept of 'meaning in human,' 'the human meaning,' and 'the meaning of the human' since ancient times, it can be said that these concepts were once shaped by logical visions with dimensions of faith, which were then translated into symbols engraved on clay tablets and written in ancient texts. The process then moved to the machine, which took its ideal place in transmitting and storing information.
                </p>
                <p>
                Thus, information transmitted and inherited through our mental vision system and our ontological mental system, which is stored in our biological embodiments and the impressions of the natural world, controls us through the developments of human stages. There is information that exerts a high sphere of influence on humans and controls most human societies. This includes informational models with certain energy dimensions that dominate a large part of human societies, such as religious systems, political systems, the postulates of physical or material reality, and the postulates of normal neurosensory perception, which refers to the coordination of what is received by the five senses and regarded as ultimate realities received from the outside world. All these models contribute to the control of human consciousness, resulting in a weak reductionism range. This reductionism is the result of the mind's limitation of deep dimensions that lie outside the relative manifestations in the external world.
                </p>
                <p>
                    On the other hand, there are fields of conflicting information in our human world, and each of them takes on an energy coordination that contradicts the other. All of this contributes to flooding the human mind and scattering it through multiple contradictions and settlements, each of which depends on a specific source. In these fields of conflicting information models, we indicate to the model of the truth of creation, the origin of creation, the reality of God's existence and non-existence as another model, and the reality of the meaning of life or the meaning of existence as another model of conflicting information fields in the program of mental vision of human consciousness. All of these fields of conflicting information are certain contributions, and every human part, whether an individual or group, adheres to a certain vision based on specific information. However, the logical image that is not realized or has not been realized by humans may conflict with the aspirations and beliefs of everyone despite their fanaticism and adherence to their belief system.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    The true power inherent in symbols, signs, geometric shapes, and geometric figures is deeper and more complex than many people might think. These different geometrical symbols and shapes are not just what they appear to be externally, or as noted in their external image and nature. All those symbols and geometric formal patterns present in external reality have complex energetic embodiments. Each of these energetic embodiments emits a typical energetic frequency that affects, in one way or another, the human subconscious and the general energy of the place in which they exist. At the same time, these symbols, signs, and geometric patterns represent folds and fields of accurate, deep, and far-reaching information flow that has a basic energetic frequency effect on the energy level of humans and the collective human subconscious. Everything that represents a certain information flow has certain energy dimensions in our world and affects the unconscious mental movement that directs human thought from near or afar.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    The energies and energy fields embodied in the various geometric shapes, symbols, and others, whose previous structural basis represents the movement of precise cosmic information responsible for the formations of reality, affect the way the human mind thinks and direct it to a certain extent. We have, in one way or another, a programmed mental vision within an informational reality network that has been installed on a complex, compact, and pre-programmed basis. This programmed information system profoundly affects the orientations of the mental structure without the mind's awareness and standard observation of this.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    On the other hand, we should refer to a sign that converges with certain points to indicate the relationship of information to energy in this specific approach and the relationship of consciousness, information, energy, and quantum levels with each other in the environment of mental consciousness and the complex inner deeper structure of the human self. These are all interconnected points on the mystical level in the existential structure in which we exist.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    In light of the advanced technologies existing in the current era, all of which hint at the power of the enormous information that flows like torrents through our human world, the indication is that this information directed through modern programmed technologies is also trying to program us within its scope. This is done by the method of its continuous and specific flow within many specific patterns programmed with its general composition, which are connected with a far inner meaning—the structure of the meanings of information that often work to direct awareness to some extent within specific perception cycles.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    In general, information in our world flows through two basic fields: one is the terrestrial field—the human field, which involves various informational and automated systems defined in the systems prevailing on Earth and contributes to the dissemination of information; and the other field is the extraterrestrial realm—the cosmic field, which humans cannot control but rather controls and programs the realm of human reality. Thus, the human race is part of a programmed information field with a complex energy dimension system that takes on a frequency energy and conglomerate approach clustered on itself.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    Information, with its complexity and cosmic and ontological coordination, is far more distant from the reality of what humans believe in their worldly interactive or communicative sphere that exists within the relativistic cycle of consciousness. This informational fabric that forms the parts of the cosmic system and the programmed human system is the inner part embroidered in the ontological program, which is the inevitability of existence. Our existence and the existence of existence are an ontological correlation governed by the inevitability of existence and the specific formation established by an ontological program, primarily through the supervision of the Greater Rear Consciousness over the entire creation process.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The word 'embroidered' has profound dimensions in this field. The ontological program is embroidered in a way that suggests the inevitability of the relational aspects that are existentially responsible for the formation and highlighting of certain meanings in reality by the informational fabric. This ontological program is embroidered and fabricated by the upper fabrication threads, which extend from the Greater Rear Consciousness of existence and take on complex metaphysical and ontological dimensions that will be referred to later.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        So this ontological program works to reflect or show a certain philosophical dynamic image of the world and a certain image of physical integration that continues its work and is based on showing the specific field of reality. This certain philosophical dynamic image of the world includes both the visible field and the invisible field, which constitutes the greatest part of reality.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        The contribution of this total ontological program comprises various cosmic aspects, and this contribution is the establishment of certain systems in reality. We comprehend and realize some of these systems, but we do not grasp the deeper aspects due to our level of informational perception cycles. The inevitability of the ontological program contributed to the evolution of life on Earth.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        There is an ingenious weaving of this cosmic informational embroidery, which shows reality as it is in its physical and non-physical forms. Both images (physical and non-physical) are part of the total system of nature programmed according to this particular essence.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        We are located in an informational ontological field that simulates a model machine designed and produced by a deep rear consciousness. That typical machine is not the same in human relative terms; rather, it is an inner generator that goes beyond the relative images of the world.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        Certainly, the certain philosophical dynamic image reflected is an image of a working system that defines our existence. The Greater Rear Consciousness contributed with its complex meta-mechanism by applying the cosmic-informational machine program, which itself contributed to weaving and embroidering a complex existential pattern—reality.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        Our world and the structure of our existence are shaped by a complexity and a certain specificity that corresponds with the deep pre-selections of the Greater Rear Consciousness that created and designed the cosmic information machine. The weaving and systematic formation of the existential image of reality are codes (ciphers) of applied and engraved information within the metaphysical formative origins of reality. What these informational codes reflect or show through their disjointed or disassembled meanings, far from encryption, is the fabric of a specific world that forms a physical, non-physical, visible, and invisible system. This fabric contracts within the parts of each other to form a system of specific threads of action known for its meeting and systematic intersection as 'life'.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        The informational fabric of the ontological program that forms the cosmic system reflects or analyzes the regular upper metaphysical image that is the deep existential code engraved in the codes of the programmed or encrypted cosmic reality system.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The informational fabric of the ontological program that forms the cosmic system reflects or analyzes the regular upper metaphysical image that is the deep existential code engraved in the codes of the programmed or encrypted cosmic reality system. Through this reflexive analysis or dissolution and reflexive logical disintegration, the methodology of reality is determined according to the coordinates of the rear-end systemic codes (which lie beyond the logical or apparent domain of existence). These codes played a primary role in establishing the information system of the cosmic and reflected that system to create the evolutionary path course in our reality.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                            The creative engineering that established the system of real existence represents an engineering directed by a Greater Rear Consciousness (a high consciousness that lies behind or lurking behind reality and omnipresence). This consciousness contributed through the method of the ontological program and the informational fabric system within it, which is responsible for the limitations of informational reality in highlighting this specific reality program we have and linking it to the inevitability of the continuous information flow.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                            Thus, the program of the ontological structure of reality is linked to the inevitability of the existence of the cosmic information system that formed the channels and manifestations of our relative reality under the supervision of existential guidance codes determined by the Greater Rear Consciousness. This supervisory action came or appeared through the higher background consciousness itself (the Greater Rear Consciousness), which is the principal supervisor of this creation process and surrounds and encompasses the universal and existential movement before everything.
