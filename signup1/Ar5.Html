            <div class="section">1.4. DIFFERENT ANATOMY OF THE HUMAN EXISTENCE</div>
            <br>
            <p>
                The physical structures, appearances, movements and external physical interactions that exist in reality and that appear in reality such as visible interactions and movements and others such as invisible interactions and movements, they all exist and are expressed as codes(ciphers) of certain information stored and engraved in the informational fabric system in the ontological program, even our biological existence by itself and the presence of our vital organs (heart..brain..kidneys..nerves..etc) within our physical body or within the impression of our physical body in this world have metaphysical high impressions that we cannot comprehend by our logical relative system which based on the illusory system.
                </p>
                <p>
                The mind within its relative system may can't imagine this or expect this, but our biological existence and the existence of every vital organ in us takes and has a metaphysical prior impression prior to the existence of the biological organ and the biological existence itself.
                </p>
                <p>
                So the biological existence of humans and the biological existence of other beings or organisms also takes impressions are inevitably predetermined and represented by certain and specific informational impressions engraved in the codes(ciphers) of the informational fabric system in the ontological program, and basically, we came through the reflection of the disintegration of informational codes engraved in the depth of the informational fabric system in the ontological program.
                </p>
                <p>
                All structures, complexities, different beings, even the conscious system of humans, and what the naked eye sees and what it does not see represents a specific type of code with accurate, complex and inner information storage and engraved in the informational fabric system in the ontological program, thus, everything, even our bodily organs, our universal existential selves, and the things around us pre-exist.
                </p>
                <p>
                That is, we exist in our earthly, physical, biological and bodily form that determined in this four-limbs and one-headed form, which is a form that has no deep explanation yet, before our actual existence, so we are pre-existence exist, and we pre-exist exist, so we are located before our specific presence, but in a deeper way than we expect or believe, in a simpler sense, we exist as an ontological informational codes (ciphers) before we exist in our physical form.
                </p>
                <p>
                It seems that this kind of talking is absurd somehow, doesn't it?!
                </p>
                <p>
                No.., it really is not absurd or meaningless, if the code that is written according to one of the programming languages has a consciousness of a certain kind, similar to human consciousness, and suddenly this code woke up to a certain type of information that was faced it, and let suppose this information was the information that i am submitting now or which i’m talking about now or information which i mentioned earlier about the same idea, this code will be surprised and wonder in its relative consciousness, and may show a similar reaction to the human reaction and action, and imagine that code encounters information that says it is inside a program - with huge information controls controlling it in order to show certain results and certain interactive movements within the reality in which it exists, In addition to all this, the code has encountered information that it is being processed by the processing system that is in a huge, precise working machine, and is therefore a small information code that does not really represent valuable thing in this world and is immersed in a multiple deep existential layers without its knowing or realizing this fact, above all this, there is an object, god or upper consciousness (the upper consciousness or god of the code in this case is the human being) supervised the creation of this machine and the processing system located within this machine, and this upper object in one way or another controls the inner state or the general programming structure of the code and its world and controls overall level of information in that world which that code is located within a part of it, in other words, that upper object controls the total state of consciousness present at this code...
                </p>
                <p>
                Now suppose that this conscious code faced this information relatively and in a certain way, it will reject this information, which is a completely different kind information about what it believes or expects this conscious code about its world, just as you human being who is reading my words now may will reject me or reject my words, and you are basically subject to the same mini-state, which I referring between time and other, from which that relatively conscious code faced that different kind of information.
                </p>
                <p>
                Certainly this code will reject this information, i.e. it will reject the nature of the information or the nature of the different and strange information object that it encountered, except in the case that this code had a certain type of very deep meditative awareness like human consciousness in its special and not ordinary state, so that code lead and drives by its state to a certain subjective process based on a different type of thinking, consideration and analysis in the reality of what that code is deeply located in, until that code eventually deduces multiple possibilities for many things of course but one of them may be enough to give a certain image that indicates to the possibility of a complex superstructure that cannot be discerned from within the confines of the machine itself which that code located in, and by intersecting with our human condition, we are also have the same state of suspended, submissive, and astonished conscious code by the new information object that will one day be presented to us or that which will we faced one day, and intersecting with our human condition.
                </p>
                <p>
                    That is, the human self is subject to a complex higher order that cannot be comprehend completely from within the boundaries of our universe and from within our earthly plane, it is a deterministic system that controls us or created us to show its far control over us in a way that is deeper than we might think with our mind biased towards superficial and silly issues of our brain and inevitably biased towards the illusory system itself.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    But if we can control the amounts of information flow that revolves around us and exploit it in some way to produce a system that is fabricated by our abilities and balanced by its working mechanism, this will make our exploitation of reality deeper and more interactive to the point that we may take a serious step towards the higher levels of consciousness, there are many things that we know about and the idea that they exist as information only in the reality system, but the mind is unable to exploit this information in an actual or practical way, the mind is unable to decipher the information that controls it in their complex forms, like the process of changing the information engraved in the DNA by means of the huge informational energy field that exists within our depths, or release the energy of the rest of the dormant neurons in our brain, all of these are processes that the human mind may aspire to in a deep-range way, but it is unable to activate it now in the layer of reality or the world of reality that is attached to it.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    The human mind proceeded to decipher relative information and exploit it in reality, but it was unable to dismantle major matters and issues, and on the other hand was drowned in its programmed vision system and interacting with the illusory system of the external reality.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    We can send commands and information to our digital electronic machines and to our artificial intelligence programs, such as computers, which itself deals with the information that is passed through many operations, such as the continuous programming process that we do to direct the machine to perform a certain work, the commands we give to the machine are a specific instruction and information feed that corresponds to the system inside the machine itself, and these processes in the end give results that correspond to the orders that were given, and all of this passes through the information field which is basically contain information that is transformed from one form to another within a certain systemic structure, and processing, storage and analysis of information are all based on a specific information performance subject to its own programming, and through all of these extensive operations and processes we are working to produce another reality that is another particular informational reality exists in the machine world.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    We are weaving and spinning a certain informational synthetic reality by the way of the machines we use to perform regular operations, and through these systematic processes that ultimately contribute to creating a virtual reality or different virtual reality systems that exist within the world of this machine which is a world of information that we have created and programmed within certain systems our realization and perception became oriented to another existential layer that made our inner comprehension unbalanced with all ontological points, but on the other hand, we have worked to exploit the information within the confines of the machine more than we have exploited within the deep confines of ourselves.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    Human consciousness, with its deep and higher levels, works to exploit the information contained in the inner field of the human self and in the outside world in a deep way, however, our inability to reach the higher levels of consciousness contributed to creating confusion and contributed to creating a barrier separating us from the deep reality, so much so, that this barrier has become hard to broken because it is lay in the deep points of the human mind that related with particular mental thinking system in the realm of earth relative consciousness.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The inner strength of the human self is based mainly on the strength of the information field and the frequency energy field, and the possibility of information and energies inherent in our inner self is in itself a possibility that refers to the ability to extract the essence of things from the world of nature to show things in their deep, different form that is deeper from their apparent form, we can exploit everything and we can mentally absorb anything by creating a connection between our inner informational self field and our inner energy self field and the world of the informational fabric system of the ontological program that controls reality and controls our mundane, mental, spiritual and the total human system, through this, a new realistic information system can be created in the mundane earthly reality itself, in addition to creating information systems and creating a virtual reality systems in the world of the machine that we have manufactured we are creating a deep intrinsic links between our informational human selves and the cosmic informational reality system itself, and this represents human movements heading towards higher levels of awareness of the true human self which is systematically opposed to some extent with the weak illusory earthly human self.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        All the information required to record, establish, or build a real living or biological system in our world was stored and was engraved in the informational fabric system of the ontological program, that is, in the ontological program which our existential consciousness structure is subject to, the informational fabric system of the ontological program is a system that weaves and wraps around everything that exists in reality, and basically everything or command is part of this informational fabric system of the ontological program because everything is a specific composition of information with a certain deep levels, even the finite imaginary and fantasies part system in humans is considered an interactive part that exists in one of the parts of this total informational fabric system of the ontological program, therefore, fantasies are another existential platform that affects us because it is part of the fields of communication with the depths of the external reality and the depths of the inner reality of the human self due to the nature of the information and the energy which are the origin of everything material and spiritual in reality…, all this indicates to the weakness of the closed reality in which humans live in our present world, on the other hand, this also refers to the state of the collective unconscious of humans which is state that subject to an illusory indoctrination system through which information rushes through the neural channels of the human brain which is itself within a specific information recruitment programmed system.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        We are closed by a specific data and information system subject to limitations and specific combination far from the real deep parts of reality, and our consciousness interacts with a specific ontological structure from information, and this is the main basis of the illusory system to which the human self is subject in our world, then mankind exists and is trapped within a system that subordinates our consciousness to it without known of our own consciousness of this, it is a system that distances us from the field of our true inner capabilities, that system worked in one way or another to strip the spirituality that connect the human self with the depths of the cosmic and existential reality, the illusory system, on the other hand, worked to obstructing consciousness and creating a certain disturbance in it that made it unable to communicate with other cosmic information systems, like advanced information systems that exist in other dimensions that go beyond our dimensional system, that is, in the dimensions beyond the three dimensions in which we live, and that system inevitably contributed to the disruption of communication with other live programs in the universe.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Inwardly, even if within a long-term possibility, the process of attracting one of the fields of information present in the system of the universe through the way of the inner information field and the energy field of the human self or through one of the modern technology designs that are not currently available in our human world and then directing that field towards a certain stereotypical direction in the system of our reality may enable us and help us to build a new living systems and build a different formative reality that appears in its initial form in our world to develop in our existential vital reality, this is possible in the long term, everything is informational ontological extension of the cosmic programmed information system movement, thus any extension that creates a specific informational or energy expressions is an extension that can be expressed in a different ways.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                            In other words, the ontological information combinations which is informational extension that penetrates our world can create live images of systems, structures that took their biological, physical specifically nature in our reality, in the long and deep term, many live, realistic images in our reality can be shaped in the way that we heading ontologically to perceive things because the ontological information combinations interact with each other by means of their interconnected inner particles in the metaphysical world of the inner upper consciousness and in the deep quantum world of the total ontological reality, since we are within a specific programmed formative ontological field, since we can connect to another programmed formative ontological field and exploit it in our reality by tracing the connections of the lines of information that formed us and that connect us on the other hand with another specific programmed formative ontological fields.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                            In fact, the information in all those programmed formative ontological field can actually collect certain codes represent movements of stereotypical information in the reality and work to bring down these codes and dismantle them and liberate them in our reality until they become a part of another specific ontological reality field, a part that interact with.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                            In order to clarify this matter, which may seem thorny in terms of its typical description, relative example can be given that brings the image closer so that the concept presented is more simple, but it should be noted that this example is confined to a specific cycle of the ontological structure, and the orientations that we refer to are beyond this cycle:
                            </p>
                            <p>
                            Access to exoplanets and extract certain samples that contain certain living patterns, i.e. live patterns of certain organisms in the event that these organisms are assumed to exist and analyses these samples carefully before entering them to planet earth, and then if the results of the analysis are acceptable, that is, they are compatible with the process of entering into our world and the matter does not pose a danger to the human race, then these specific samples can be entered, and then conducting experiments on the genetic field or the physical biological field of those organisms or living patterns to the extent that these experiments ultimately aim to manipulate those samples until reaching a new certain living biological system pattern, in other words, experiments aims to produce a living organism with new evolutionary dimensions that have been achieved and reached by the manipulative human level within the scientific community, and then orienting this being to a certain extent to make it merge with the structure of the human world and create another evolutionary balance in the ring of reality in our human world, and if this is above all possible and compatible with the environment of our planet, that is, that living sample can be entered into our planet while it remains alive and with no change in their particular biological or physical state or death (i.e. death of the organism) or an unexpected error occurs, and that this sample (the external organism) must certainly be compatible with the environment of biological scientific experiments in which it will inevitably be entered…, this relative example indicates or shows that we were somehow able to actually decompile certain ontological code and exploit a certain information flow outside the planet earth, and editing, manipulating, modify it until it reaches the stage of merging with the environment of the planet earth and then merging with the environment of the human world itself later if that was possible…, this may seem very difficult from a biological, cosmological and systemic point of view in general, but it remains a possibility in the long run and is likely to happen on a logical level despite the complexity of its inevitable dimensions…, there are more profound and complex examples than this relative example, and perhaps those examples may range for many within the meaning of imagination itself, but imagination itself is nothing but a form of reality that is different from the form and the order of our reality.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Relative images of reality can be magnified to become images with high accuracy and meaning that occur in our world, meaning that small facts and simple processes are essentially extensions and expressions of the high-level structures and matters that occur in our existential system without our awareness of them except in the case of deep mental processing of things and matters. This process allows the mind to engage with and become qualified to receive the depths of relative images, which are reflections of deep functions in the total existential reality. Many processes whose existential movement we refer to differently from the apparent patterns upon which the mind relies are aimed at projecting advanced, high-level external information worlds into our earthly world.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                The existential processes that may transcend the system of the relative world of the ontology of the mental structure of human beings may be considered by the mind in its relative state under certain restrictions as illusions or supernatural matters that we cannot reach. However, this is not true because the inner workings of things are related to a deep eternal field, and everything we are part of is intricately interconnected through their attachment to this eternal field, which in this case is the inner upper consciousness. These existential processes are akin to downloading a certain program or application from outside the computer system into its system, where this program or application, programmed on specific informational aspects, interacts with other programmed parts within the overall system environment. Information, data, and commands in the system were brought into being by the external hand that created the system itself—the hand of the creator, which is the human or the greater consciousness in this relative case. Thus, we are a part that interacts with the rest of the parts despite the restrictions that control us. Activating deep existential movements is essentially a process of communication with cosmic programs and interconnected existential information within the limits of our ontological restrictions, much like the precise interactive formation pattern in the machine, which parallels the human condition but in a more distant and profound way.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                In the previous example, the program in the machine from a distant perspective is similar to the human mind because both exist in a superficial illusion world representing their relative reality system. Both cases, with their specific interactions, are subject to a programmed system—a shallow reality that we are accustomed to. Our case is both near and far from the interactions within the machine world, but our own consciousness is the dividing line in the deep phase between all aspects that the mind might suspect.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                The computer system interacts with its parts, itself, and with all the programs downloaded into it, but it remains within the constraints of its relative, programmed virtual interaction, as it is clear to us as human beings. We, as human beings, are subject to an ontological order and principle that is more complex and profound than we might think. We exist within a system that represents a specific informational constraint engraved in the ontological structure in which we were born and formed. This structure is filled with the energy of inner consciousness of reality—the inner upper consciousness. Realizing the depth of things requires the mind to delve into approaches that are not subject to the apparent logic of reality.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                Most of the deep existential movements are complex aspects of stereotypical dimensions and formations that the human mind has not been able to probe deeply. Our minds have become immersed in the world of technology and the illusory system, of which we are a part. This immersion has kept us from settling the deep points in our existential mental orientations and realizing them in our existential structure.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                Humans have become distant from the spirituality of the natural world and its deep orbits, where our origins lie. The intersections of the true reality system and the hidden path of liberation towards a new world are obscured. This is why we have referred to the need to expand our awareness of existential movements and introduce new existential movements into our ontological structure. However, this becomes challenging when we are trapped in the typical network of the illusory system and its complex informational structure. Therefore, the near goal is to realize and comprehend the illusory system in order to break its restrictions that govern us in various forms.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                Many of the stereotypes and existential movement images we refer to may seem strange and distant from the relative perception orbit of the mind that is stuck in the illusory system. This relative perception orbit is itself a victim of the restrictions of the illusory system that grips human consciousness between the claws of its program.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    All information that exists in the world of human reality and the world of cosmic reality itself is recorded in the informational fabric system of the ontological program. This information can be accessed in a deep way, even if it seems distant from us. Perhaps other developed consciousness units in different dimensions of the universe are capable of accessing certain points of that informational fabric system. It is possible to access fields of information where the movement of the real world and past events were recorded, as well as fields where the movement of the future and upcoming events are recorded. Additionally, fields may exist containing logical sequences of the present events and their probabilities of transformation or development into other events—something that will be explained later according to different ontological principles.

                                    The ontological program in question contains information about every object, order, or event that was created, has occurred, will be created, or will happen. It is the existential programmatic, formative coordination of everything that has appeared and will appear in the entire ontological system of the world and the universe. Our human part and relative existence are recorded and engraved within a specific part of the codes of the ontological program. We are subject, from the upper side, to the reflections and directions of the work of that program that directs our existential code within the parts of its total system.

                                    We have not and will not reach the end, which does not exist in our limited perceptual view. However, what I can point out now, before closing the first part of the beginning, is that the particular process of deconstructing the ontological structure of the reality information system program is defined here according to a specific methodology. What its structure has been disassembled and referred to the horizon of its flow in this process is confined to a specific dismantling mental methodology system that simulates the world of existence and the total reality according to the same analysis-specific methodology.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                    Every individual, human or non-human, whether trivial or genius, represents a form of a certain philosophy with specific energy and influence dimensions that he himself may not realize. He may not be aware that he is delving into something fundamentally beyond his mental and cognitive level.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                    Deconstructing the ontological structure of the reality information system program has no first or last limit. Rather, it has a previous eternal field and a subsequent eternal infinite field that we are unable to process or dismantle on the conscious human level. However, our spiritual, psychological, mental, and intellectual desire to realize and absorb the ontological structure of our reality and dismantle its parts pushes the movement of our consciousness forward, even if in a certain relative way in the world of the illusory system or in the structure of our ontological existence, programmed according to predetermined performance and directional coordination.
                                    </p>

                                    Certainly, we did not observe and absorb the deep states of reality in the first place. As much as we indicated the places of their existence, most of the observation and absorbing processes of the human mind are located in the relative orbit of reality. Real inner monitoring requires more detailed, long, and deep analyses that extend beyond the specific points indicated. The deconstruction of the complex informational influence on the collective unconscious human mind is also a specific analysis that emerged in many points and ways, whether directly or indirectly. However, it did not actually treat the deep fundamentals for various reasons that will be indicated later. Nevertheless, what has been deconstructed from influences on the collective human unconscious is very limited but serves as basic signals and radical concepts to indicate a statement and deep basic concepts later. All of this is only the beginning of a systematic line that indicates a new philosophical and esoteric methodology movement.
